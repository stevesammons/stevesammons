Self-hosted WordPress on Apache (Csco theme, Wordfence, ModSecurity, Site Kit, MailPoet).
This repo holds code that gets published to the site. The site itself is managed through
its REST API as the `claude` administrator.

## Access

- Run `python3 tools/wp.py check` at the start of any WordPress work.
- Credentials come only from the `WP_USER` and `WP_APP_PASSWORD` environment variables.
  Never print, log, echo or commit them, and never ask for them in chat.
- If `check` reports "not logged in", Wordfence's "Disable WordPress application passwords"
  option (Wordfence > All Options > Brute Force Protection) may have been re-enabled.

## Ground rules

Ask first, and wait for a clear yes, before anything readers would see or that is hard to undo:
- publishing, unpublishing, scheduling or deleting posts and pages
- sending or scheduling MailPoet emails or newsletters
- installing, activating, deactivating, updating or deleting plugins or themes
- creating, changing or deleting users, roles or Application Passwords
- changing site settings, menus, permalinks, Wordfence or other security settings
- deleting media or comments

Allowed without asking: reading anything, creating or editing drafts, and checking live pages.

Always:
- Before editing existing content, save its `content.raw` (`?context=edit`) to `backups/`
  (git-ignored) so it can be restored.
- After publishing, load the live page and confirm it renders.
- Report what changed with links. If something failed, say so.

## Site quirks

- The site's content filters add `<p>` tags and curly quotes inside inline `<script>` blocks.
  Ship scripts as base64 `data:` URIs, as `hebron-map/publish.py` does.
- ModSecurity rejects requests with a bare or unusual User-Agent. Send a real one.
- Use the block editor. Put custom HTML inside a `<!-- wp:html -->` block.

## Known pages

- 3169 Hebron in Caleb's Story. Interactive map in `hebron-map/`, publish with
  `python3 hebron-map/publish.py --apply`.
- /caleb/ Caleb profile. /give-me-the-hard-one/ reflection.

## Back-to-the-story links

Reference pages (character profiles and place maps) get a "Back to the story" card at the top
and bottom via `python3 backlinks/apply.py PAGE_ID POST_IDS SUBJECT --apply`. It only links
posts that are already published, so scheduled posts appear automatically on their publish date.
Done so far: 2903 Ahab (post 2943).
